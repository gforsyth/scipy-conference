Dear {{ name }},

Thank you for agreeing to be part of the Program Committee this year.

We are sending you this friendly reminder to please take a look at submissions
assigned to you in eTouches to check for conflicts of interest in your
assigments. The more time we have to find alternate reviewers (if necessary) the
easier this is for everyone.

Also, a reminder that if you complete your reviews by the end of today (April
10, 2017) you will receive a 'Top Reviewer' sticker as a small token of our
gratitude.

If you haven't logged in yet, you can access the review system
https://scipy2017.scipy.org/eSites/220975/Homepage and login using your email
address as the login and the default password SciPy2017*.

Please also see the Reviewer Guidelines (https://scipy2017.scipy.org/ehome/220975/532468/) and the conflicts-of-interest guidelines on the same page.
