Call for Papers
===============

Congratulations on having your abstract accepted for this year's event -- we 
look forward to seeing your poster or presentation! As in the past, SciPy2017 
will release a conference proceedings, and you are invited to contribute a 
full-length paper (up to 8 pages) expanding on your abstract.

The proceedings are aimed at highlighting significant contributions to 
scientific computing in Python, such as:

- new software packages that support the Scientific Python Stack
- domain-specific applications of Python in any field of research
- significant improvements to existing software packages
- hardware systems designed to support the Python stack
- applications of scientific computing in education

Papers should be submitted as pull requests by May 30th.  At that point, the 
two-week open review period will begin.  During this time, members from the 
program committee and the scientific Python community at large may provide 
feedback, which should be addressed through discussion on GitHub and by 
updating the pull request.
