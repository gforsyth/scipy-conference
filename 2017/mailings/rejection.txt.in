Dear {{ names }},

Thank you for submitting to SciPy 2017. We had 148 submissions
for 63 speaking slots this year and we are looking forward to the best SciPy yet!

Because of the large number of submissions and a limited number of talk slots,
we were forced to decline many high quality talk proposals. Unfortunately, after
review by the Program Committee, your talk proposal has been declined. 


The SciPy 2017 Program Chairs,
Gil Forsyth
Lorena Barba
