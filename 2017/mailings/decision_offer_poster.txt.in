"{{ title }}", was not selected for inclusion on this year's program. However,
on the recommendation of the symposia chair for the {{ track }} track, we would
like to offer you the opportunity to present a poster at SciPy 2017.

Please confirm by May 5th (that's this Friday!) if you would like to present a
poster at SciPy and that you are still available to attend in Austin on July
12th - 14th.

Please confirm by May 5th (that's this Friday!) that you are still available to

The talks and posters will be given during the three main days of the conference

If you would like to have your bio and photograph listed on the conference Web

Call for Papers
===============

Congratulations on having your abstract accepted for this year's event -- we 
look forward to seeing your poster or presentation! As in the past, SciPy2017 
will release a conference proceedings, and you are invited to contribute a 
full-length paper (up to 8 pages) expanding on your abstract.

The proceedings are aimed at highlighting significant contributions to 
scientific computing in Python, such as:

- new software packages that support the Scientific Python Stack
- domain-specific applications of Python in any field of research
- significant improvements to existing software packages
- hardware systems designed to support the Python stack
- applications of scientific computing in education

Papers should be submitted as pull requests by May 30th.  At that point, the 
two-week open review period will begin.  During this time, members from the 
program committee and the scientific Python community at large may provide 
feedback, which should be addressed through discussion on GitHub and by 
updating the pull request.
