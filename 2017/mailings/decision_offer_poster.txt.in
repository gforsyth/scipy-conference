Dear {{ names }},

We received many great talk submissions this year and unfortunately your talk,
"{{ title }}", was not selected for inclusion on this year's program. However,
on the recommendation of the symposia chair for the {{ track }} track, we would
like to offer you the opportunity to present a poster at SciPy 2017.

Please confirm by May 5th (that's this Friday!) if you would like to present a
poster at SciPy and that you are still available to attend in Austin on July
12th - 14th.

Thank you and we hope to see you in Austin!

Sincerely,
Gil Forsyth & Lorena Barba
SciPy 2017 Program co-chairs
