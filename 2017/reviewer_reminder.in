Dear {{ name }},

Thanks for being part of the SciPy 2017 Program Committee!

It looks like you have not logged in to the review system and we are now halfway
through the review period. We need you to [log in][0] now and check your
assignmentsâ€”then let us know of any Conflict of Interest so we can re-assign the
review. (See the [Reviewer Guidelines][1] for our definition of COI.)

Please remember that your reviews are due on April 19th. And if you complete
your reviews by the end of day today, you'll get an awesome "Top Reviewer"
sticker.

Log in now using your email address and SciPy2017* as password (change it!).

Program Co-Chairs,
Lorena Barba and Gil Forsyth
