Dear {{ names }},

Thank you for submitting to SciPy 2017. We had 148 submissions
for 63 speaking slots this year and we are looking forward to the best SciPy yet!

The large number of submissions means that
we had to reject many high-quality talk proposals. Unfortunately, after
review by the Program Committee, your talk was declined.

This year, SciPy moved to a double-open peer review process, and we hope
you will find value in the candid comments from your reviewers. Also note that 
this year, SciPy requested that reviewers abide by new Guidelines [1], aimed
at interrupting implicit bias.

We hope you still find it valuable to attend SciPy 2017, and consider
submitting your work in future editions. Our conference continues to 
develop a strong community that values diversity, abides by its code of
conduct, and benefits from open discourse.

The SciPy 2017 Program Chairs,
Gil Forsyth & Lorena A. Barba
