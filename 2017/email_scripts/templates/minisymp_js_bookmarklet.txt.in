Hello chairs,

The review page is now closed and we have received {{ total_reviews }} reviews, {{ review_pct }}% of perfect review completion.

Now it is time to begin selecting the program for SciPy 2018.

We received {{ total_submissions }} submissions this year and we have slots for {{ domain_slots }} talk(s) in the {{ domain }} minisymposium track.

Decisions are due to us end-of-day March 27th

- Note if submission is a poster or a talk
- You can choose to offer a poster to a worthy submission that doesnâ€™t make the cut
- Use your judgment, if a review seems rushed or less reliable, you can ignore it at your discretion
- If you have a conflict of interest for a given submission in your domain, consult with your co-chair and defer to their decision for the submission in question
- If you and your co-chair have a conflict, please let Gil and Lorena know

If you haven't yet logged in to EasyChair, it's a good time to check it out and begin familiarizing yourself with the interface.

The login page is here: https://easychair.org/account/signin.cgi

If you have any issues logging in that aren't solved with the "Forgotten password" prompts, contact Gil or Jill Cowen.

If you are prompted with a "Choose role" prompt after logging in, the appropriate role is "track chair (SciPy 2018 Talks and Posters)".

After logging in, you can click "Submissions" and then select "View by topic" from the right-hand sidebar to browse submissions in your topic/mini-symposia.

If a talk submission has fewer than 3 reviews, please add or solicit additional reviews to make up the difference.
To add a review, select the Submission from the "Submissions" page and click the blue `i` info icon, then select "Add Review" from the top-right toolbar.

The most useful view for reading over reviews is available by clicking "Status" in the top menu-bar. (This also provides the easiest eyeball check for how many reviews each submission has received).

Due to the way we configured EasyChair this year (our first outing) all of the submissions are listed and there does not appear to be a way to filter the visible submissions.

That being said, a late night and some light javascript hacking has yielded results and below you will find a bit of bookmarklet code that, if added as bookmark in your browser, will let you toggle between all submissions and only those in your domain.

The easiest way to create the bookmarklet is to bookmark the current page, then edit the bookmark and replace target URL with the bit of javascript below.

Finally, we are still learning our way around EasyChair.  In the interest of not broadcasting decisions early, please do not register any decisions in EasyChair.
If you have any tips or tricks, please share them on the organizers slack. 

Let us know if you have any questions,
Gil and Lorena
